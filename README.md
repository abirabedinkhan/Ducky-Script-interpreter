# Ducky Script Compiler

Ducky Script is the payload language of Hak5 gear. Since its introduction with the USB Rubber Ducky in 2010, Ducky Script has grown in capability while maintaining simplicity. Aided by Bash for logic and conditional operations, Ducky Script provides multi-vector functions for all Hak5 payload platforms.

It is a simple python script to run Ducky Script. I also add some additional functions.




## Installation

Install Ducky Script with pip3

```bash
  cd my-project
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  py .\main.py YOURFILENAME.dd
  # OR
  py .\main.py # To run defult file (payload.dd)
```
